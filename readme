create deck of cards X
deal cards           X
front and back cards look good -- done in css
dealer gets 1 card face up to player
add up the numbers of the cards
add buttons to hit or stick
dealer will hit or stick dependant on certain rules
add a betting system - have to bet, then press button to start the game
add money
W or L state - run out of money - if ( money <= 0 ){player loses}
animate cards being dealt and then flipping over -- possible with css animation however not neccessary
set value of each card so the computer can add them together



make the bet buttons actually do something
make the cards show onscreen









game start player cant see any cards
player places bet
presses DEAL button when ready
cards get dealt
player can pres HIT or STICK to play the game
once player presses STICK then the dealer will play
no more buttons can be pressed at this point and the player will just see if w or l
after W or L, cards are added back to the deck and the deck is reshuffled
player can bet again
this loops until the player quits or runs out of money
